# E-Invoice


#OBJECTIVE

I developed a windows application software with a convenient interface to get data from the user for e-invoicing transactions. With this software, dozens of e-invoice information can be quickly received and stored. Apart from these, the program provides convenience for the software developer to easily see the information about the data packets coming from the user. 

I added this project in my summer internship. Here it is my rapor !
